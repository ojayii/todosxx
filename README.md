### The goal

Users should be able to:

- Add todo items through the input field at the bottom of the page.
- 'Check' completed todos by clicking the checkbox inside of the todo item.
- Checked/completed todos get removed from the 'pending' tab, and move into the 'completed' tab.
- 'Uncheck' completed todos by clicking the checkbox inside the completed todo item.
- Permanently delete todo items by clicking the 'x' button inside of completed todo items.
- Search through pending todo items with the aid of the search field at the top of the page
- Todo items should persist on page reload.
